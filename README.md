I'm a passionate Software Engineer with over 16 years of building software solutions, spans both full-time roles and independent projects. Iâ€™ve got exposure on wide range of platforms from websites and mobile apps to games and automation systems.

I also have a security background including hands-on experience as a security analyst and engineer. I enjoy tackling tech and operational challenges while keeping things compliant with security standards like PCI DSS and ISO 27001.

Beyond coding, I love to write. I've published a couple of research papers and hold two copyrights in authentication method research. My motto, "Agul ku Payung Alus," drives me to deliver top-notch work on every project.
